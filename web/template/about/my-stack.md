# My tech stack

Firstly, if you wish to explore my configuration files, you can access them
[here](https://github.com/RyanQueirozS/dotfiles). Secondly, I must emphasize
that I take no responsibility for the links provided below. If any of them are
replaced or become insecure, it's crucial to note that you chose to click on
them.

## Linux Distro

I've hopped around a few Linux distros - started with Arch (btw), then tried
Mint, Ubuntu, and landed on **Debian**. But honestly, none of them have given me
that 100% content feeling. Arch? Well, it's a bit scary, especially without
backups. Mint and Ubuntu? Boilerplate problems galore. Debian is like a mix of
both - not too much boilerplate, not too scary. If I ever switch again,
thinking about giving NixOS a shot.

## Neovim

I mostly use Neovim as my code editor, nothing feels better than it, but if I
do find a better alternative I won't think twice about changing it.

There are some stuff that I dislike about Nvim, most of them are in regards to
the plugins themselves. Big, well-maintained ones like
[treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) are awesome,
but not every plugin is like that. Had a few that got discontinued or stopped doing what I needed.
Always found a replacement, though.

## C/C++

C and C++ are for sure my most programmed languages. I use it for about
everything, all the way from simple CLI tools to a game engine using SDL.

## Golang

Golang is my second most preferred language. Simple syntax and easy to debug.
It's super common to write lots of lines and have no mistakes in the
compilation.
